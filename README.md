# Housing Price Prediction

## Problem Statement

Housing is an important investment tool in the toolkit of any investors. However, with a multiplicity of factors when choosing a house, it is often difficult to pinpoint the most important factors influencing sale price of houses. 

To help investors and homeowners of Ames pick the best house and the most worthwhile upgrades in order to optmise sale price, we will build a predictor which predicts the sale price base on various aspects of a house, from floor area to roofing type, before identifying some of the most important factors which helps owners maximise the sale value of their house. 

**Role taken: Advisor to potential property investors and homeowners**

## Methodology

![Methodology](assets/project_methodology.png)

## Model Evaluation

![Model_Evaluation](assets/model_evaluation.png)

Feature set 16 was able to achieve the best overall score taking into consideration all 5 models. The best model which was able to achieve the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was the Lasso Regression. 

Feature set 16 was passed through the best model (Lasso Regressor) for further hyperparameter tuning and below is the scatter plot comparing the predicted house price and actual house price of our model, which indicates a prediction generally closed to the actual value, although there are still rooms for improvement for properties with higher sale price.

## Interpretation and Recommendations

We then pick out the top 15 most important features having a positive or negative impact on price.

**Most Important Factors Influencing Sale Price** 

![most_impt_features](assets/most_impt_features.png)

We see that the most important features influencing sale price can be grouped in a few categories:

<span style="color:green">Features with positive influence on price.</span>

**Area**
- We see that among the most important features influencing sale price are some of the area features, most important among them `Gr Liv Area`, but also `Lot Area`, `BsmtFin SF1` and `1st Flr SF`. 

**Quality**
- Other quality measurement such as `Overall Qual`, `Overall Cond`, `Functional`, `Kitchen Qual` and `Basement Qual` may also provide valuable info in helping someone to judge sale price. This points to the importance of perhaps hiring a professional property valuer before making any investment decisions.

**Neighborhoods**
- We have also identified some neighborhoods that has the most potential in terms of getting a good sale price, these includes, `Northridge Heights`, `Somerset` and `Northridge`.

**Proximity**
- The proximity to urban features such as roads or parks do not actually matter that much. 

**Roof material** 
- It is better to choose Standard (Composite) Shingle as roofing material




<span style="color:red">Features with negative influence on price.</span>

**House Age** 
- The most important feature having a negative impact on price is the `Age Since Built` feature. `Age Since Remod/Add` also have some negative influence on price.

**Neighborhoods**
- You may want to avoid buying properties in neighborhoods such as `Edwards`, `Old Town`, `Iowa DOT and Rail Road` and `Meadow Village`

**Zoning**
- Properties located within commercial zones may not be the best investment

**Heating Type**
- Property with `Gravity Furnace` and `Wall Furnace` generally do not get you a higher price, this is perhaps due to the fact that these are more traditional heating technologies

**Number of Kitchens**
- Quite counter intuitively, the higher the number of kichens, the lower the price, this is perhaps because single family households generally have only need for one kitchens, while a larger number of kitchen generally means that more than 1 household resides in the property

**Basement**
- An `unfinished basement` generally fetches you a lower price, same goes for basements `without exposure`

**Garage type**
- Avoid properties with a `carport` garage, these are sheltered garages attached to a property

**Utilities**
- Avoid properties with `No sewage`

**Proxmity**
- Avoid properties adjacent to the E-W railroad.
