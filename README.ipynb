    "\n",
    "**Area**\n",
    "- We see that among the most important features influencing sale price are some of the area features, most important among them `Gr Liv Area`, but also `Lot Area`, `BsmtFin SF1` and `1st Flr SF`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality**\n",
    "- Other quality measurement such as `Overall Qual`, `Overall Cond`, `Functional`, `Kitchen Qual` and `Basement Qual` may also provide valuable info in helping someone to judge sale price. This points to the importance of perhaps hiring a professional property valuer before making any investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neighborhoods**\n",
    "- We have also identified some neighborhoods that has the most potential in terms of getting a good sale price, these includes, `Northridge Heights`, `Somerset` and `Northridge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proximity**\n",
    "- The proximity to urban features such as roads or parks do not actually matter that much. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Roof material** \n",
    "- It is better to choose Standard (Composite) Shingle as roofing material\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">Features with negative influence on price.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**House Age** \n",
    "- The most important feature having a negative impact on price is the `Age Since Built` feature. `Age Since Remod/Add` also have some negative influence on price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neighborhoods**\n",
    "- You may want to avoid buying properties in neighborhoods such as `Edwards`, `Old Town`, `Iowa DOT and Rail Road` and `Meadow Village`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zoning**\n",
    "- Properties located within commercial zones may not be the best investment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heating Type**\n",
    "- Property with `Gravity Furnace` and `Wall Furnace` generally do not get you a higher price, this is perhaps due to the fact that these are more traditional heating technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Kitchens**\n",
    "- Quite counter intuitively, the higher the number of kichens, the lower the price, this is perhaps because single family households generally have only need for one kitchens, while a larger number of kitchen generally means that more than 1 household resides in the property\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basement**\n",
    "- An `unfinished basement` generally fetches you a lower price, same goes for basements `without exposure`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Garage type**\n",
    "- Avoid properties with a `carport` garage, these are sheltered garages attached to a property\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utilities**\n",
    "- Avoid properties with `No sewage`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proxmity**\n",
    "- Avoid properties adjacent to the E-W railroad."
